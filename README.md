# NN-implementation: breast cancer data set


This project has two problems:

- Using the Iris data set (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.htm), two neural networks with different cost functions and initializations are implemented and compared. 

- Using the Breast Cancer data set from UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer) a neural network is implemented using keras. One hidden layer is used, where different activation functions, loss functions and regularization methods are tested and then compated.
