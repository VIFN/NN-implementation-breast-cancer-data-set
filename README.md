# NN-implementation: breast cancer data set


This project has two problems:

- Using the Iris data set, two neural networks with different cost functions and initializations are implemented and compared. 

- Using the Breast Cancer data set from UCI () a neural network is implemented using keras. One hidden layer is used, where different activation functions, loss functions and regularization methods are tested and then compated.
